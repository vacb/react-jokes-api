# Dad jokes React app

## Background

This is a simple React app using class components. It fetches a list of jokes from an [API](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api) which can then be up/down voted. The jokes and votes are persisted in local storage.

The project was built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to make API calls.

Useful things I practiced while doing this project included: 
- React state management
- React lifecycle methods
- using local storage
- event handling
- API calls and async JavaScript
- dealing with a loading state

## To do

- Work on the app's behaviour when a joke's votes cause its position to swap - this doesn't currently provide a good user experience
- Responsive styling
